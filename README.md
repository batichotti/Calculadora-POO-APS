# Calculadora-POO-APS

## **Project Overview**

This project is developed as part of the *Software Analysis and Design* course and aims to implement a calculator following the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** paradigm. The focus of this project is not merely on the functionality of the calculator but on demonstrating a thorough understanding and application of OOP principles.

The calculator is implemented entirely in **C++**, showcasing the use of core OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## **Objectives**

1. **Demonstrate OOP Principles**: Highlight the importance of OOP design in software development by utilizing robust and modular code architecture.
2. **Encapsulation and Modularity**: Structure the application in a way that separates logic into distinct, manageable components.
3. **Reusability**: Create a design that allows for easy extension or modification of the calculator's functionalities.

## **Features**

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Operations**: Extendable functionality for operations such as exponentiation or trigonometric calculations.
- **Modular Design**: Each operation is encapsulated in separate classes to ensure modularity.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to handle exceptions like division by zero.
- **Scalable Architecture**: New features can be added by extending or overriding base classes.

## **Technical Details**

- **Language**: C++ (Standard 17 or higher recommended)
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming
- **Compiler Requirements**: GCC, Clang, or MSVC
- **Development Environment**: Any C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion) or text editor with build tools
